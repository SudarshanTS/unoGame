		The game is for 2-10 players, ages 7 and over. Every player starts with seven cards, and they are dealt face down. The rest of the cards are placed in a Draw Pile face down. Next to the pile a space should be designated for a Discard Pile. The top card should be placed in the Discard Pile, and the game begins!<br><br><br>
		You have to match either by the number, color, or the symbol/Action. For instance, if the Discard Pile has a red card that is an 8 you have to place either a red card or a card with an 8 on it. You can also play a Wild card (which can alter current color in play).<br><br><br>
		If the player has no matches or they choose not to play any of their cards even though they might have a match, they must draw a card from the Draw pile. If that card can be played, play it. Otherwise, the game moves on to the next person in turn. You can also play a Wild card, or a Wild Draw Four card on your turn.<br><br>
		The game continues until a player has one card left. The moment a player has just one card they must click “UNO!” button. If they are caught not clicking “Uno” by another player before the next player has taken their turn, that player must draw two new cards as a penalty. Assuming that the player is unable to play/discard their last card and needs to draw, but after drawing, is then able to play/discard that penultimate card, the player has to repeat the action of calling out “Uno” button. The bottom line is – clicking “Uno” needs to be repeated every time you are left with one card.<br>
		<h1>Action Cards:</h1><br> Besides the number cards, there are several other cards that help mix up the game. These are called Action or Symbol cards.

       <li>
       	R – If going clockwise, switch to counterclockwise or vice versa.
       </li>
        <li>S – When a player places this card, the next player has to skip their turn. If turned up at the beginning, the first player loses his/her turn.<br></li>
        <li>+2 – When a person places this card, the next player will have to pick up two cards and forfeit his/her turn.<br></li>
        <li>W – This card represents all four colors, and can be placed on any card. The player has to state which color it will represent for the next player. It can be played regardless of whether another card is available.<br></li>
        <li>+4 – This acts just like the wild card except that the next player also has to draw four cards as well as forfeit his/her turn. With this card, you must have no other alternative cards to play that matches the color of the card previously played. If you play this card illegally, you may be challenged by the other player to show your hand to him/her. If guilty, you need to draw 4 cards. If not, the challenger needs to draw 6 cards instead.
       </li>
     </ul>
    <h1>Two Player</h1>
         For two players, there is a slight change of rules:
         Reverse works like Skip<br>
         Play Skip, and you may immediately play another card<br>
          If you play a Draw Two or Wild Draw Four card, your opponent has to draw the number of cards required, and then play immediately resumes back on your turn.<br>

          Once a player has no cards remaining, the game round is over,the game begins over again.
